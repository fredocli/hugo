# MATCHA CUSTARD

## INGREDIENTS


- 400 g whole milk
- 100 g whipping cream
- 100 g caster sugar
- 100 g egg yolks (5 pcs.)
- 40 g corn starch
- 5 g Matcha tea

## PREPARATION

Pour milk and whipping cream into a saucepan with about half of the sugar.
Put the saucepan on the stove and bring to a boil.
Stir in the milk once in a while so it does not burn.
Whisk the egg yolks and the rest of the sugar in a bowl until it becomes light and fluffy.
Add cornstarch and whisk thoroughly.
Sift and pour the boiling milk into the egg/sugar mixture while whipping.
Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and put it on the stove.
Whisk vigorously for about 1 minute until the cream becomes thick.
Pour the cream into a bowl and cover the surface with a piece of plastic film.
The plastic film should not be placed over the bowl but directly on the top of the cream.
Let it cool in the refrigerator.
When the cream has cooled, remove the plastic film and whisk the cream thoroughly.
The cream must be smooth and lump-free before you use it.
Add Matcha tea and whisk the cream thoroughly.
