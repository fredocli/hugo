# HAZELNUT PRALINÉ 50%

## INGREDIENTS


- 250 g hazelnuts without skin
- 250 g caster sugar
- 60 g water
- 150 g dark chocolate 57% cocoa

## BEFORE YOU START

Turn on the convection oven and set it to 150°C.
Prepare a baking sheet with baking paper.

## PREPARATION

Put the hazelnuts on another baking sheet or in an oven proof dish.
Bake for about 30 minutes.
Remember to stir in them occasionally to achieve an even roasting.

Pour water in a saucepan and add the sugar.
Put the saucepan on the stove over medium heat until it boils.
When the syrup reaches a temperature of 120°C, add the roasted hazelnuts.
Stir and mix the roasted hazelnuts and the syrup together.
After a few minutes, the syrup starts to crystallize.
Continue boiling while stirring constantly and gently.
The sugar begins to melt and caramelize.
Turn down the heat and continue to stir.
All the sugar must be melted and caramelized.
As soon as they have a nice caramel colour, the hazelnuts are finished.
Quickly pour them onto the prepared baking sheet with baking paper.

When the hazelnuts and the caramel is cooled down to room temperature, chop them with a food processor for about 2 minutes, until it becomes liquid.
Add the dark chocolate and run the food processor again.
Once the chocolate is melted, take the praliné out of the food processor and allow it to cool down to room temperature.
