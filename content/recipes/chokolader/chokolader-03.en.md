- 300 g slivered almonds
- 100 g light cane sugar
- 1 pc. vanilla pod
- 3 tbsp. water

## PREPARATION

Turn on the convection oven and set it to 150°C.

Spread slivered almonds and sugar in a single layer on a baking sheet with baking paper.
Bake for about 30 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes.
The sugar will settle on the almonds.
Take the almonds out of the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet.

Temper your chocolate to about 30°C.
Check the temperature of your slivered almonds, they should also be around 30°C.

Mix the roasted slivered almonds with the milk chocolate.
