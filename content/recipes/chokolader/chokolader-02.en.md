# TRUFFLES

For about 72 truffles.

## INGREDIENTS


- 165 g whipping cream
- 50 g glucose
- 300 g chocolate 67% cocoa
- 35 g unsalted butter

- Dark coating chocolate
- Cocoa powder

## PREPARATION

Chop the chocolate coarsely.
Bring whipping cream and glucose to the boiling point.
Pour 1/3 of the boiling whipping cream into the chocolate and stir with a rubber spatula.
Gradually, add the rest of the whipping cream until the chocolate is melted.
Add the butter when the ganache is between 40°C and 45°C.
Stir the ganache until the butter is melted and the mass is uniform.
Cover the bowl with plastic film and keep the ganache at room temperature until thick enough to hold shape.
Use a piping bag to pipe small balls of ganache.
Let them harden in the refrigerator.
Roll the balls between your hands to get them shaped perfectly round.
Dip them in tempered dark coating chocolate and then roll them in cocoa powder.
