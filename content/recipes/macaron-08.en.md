## INGREDIENTS


- 130 g whipping cream
- 225 g milk chocolate
- 20 g unsalted butter
- 3 g tonka beans

## PREPARATION

Use a mortar to crush the tonka beans coarsely.
Pour the whipping cream into a saucepan and put the saucepan on the stove over low flame.
When the whipping cream has boiled, remove the saucepan from the stove and add the crushed tonka beans.
Let the tonka beans infuse for about 5 minutes.
Reheat the whipping cream to about 80°C.
Sift the whipping cream with a fine sieve.
Check that the whipping cream weighs approximately 125 g.
If necessary, add a bit water.
Pour the hot whipping cream into the milk chocolate a bit at a time while stirring constantly to achieve a soft and shiny ganache.
Add the butter when the ganache is between 40°C and 45°C.
Stir in the ganache until the butter is melted.
Cover the ganache with a piece of plastic film and put it in the refrigerator.
