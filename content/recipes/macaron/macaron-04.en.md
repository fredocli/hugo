## INGREDIENTS


- 50 g whipping cream
- 225 g milk chocolate
- 20 g salted butter
- 45 g caster sugar
- 50 g orange juice
- 1/2 orange zest

## PREPARATION

Boil the sugar without water until it is caramelized.
Carefully pour the whipping cream, orange peel and orange juice over to stop the caramelization.
Stir thoroughly.
Sift the liquid with a fine sieve and check that the liquid weighs approximately 130 g.
If necessary, add a bit water.
Pour the caramel into the milk chocolate a bit at a time while stirring constantly to achieve a soft and shiny ganache.
Add the butter when the ganache is between 40°C and 45°C.
Stir in the ganache until the butter is melted.
Cover the ganache with a piece of plastic film and put it in the refrigerator.
