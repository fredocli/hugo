## INGREDIENTS


- 25 g cocoa powder
- 125 g almond flour
- 150 g icing sugar
- 55 g egg whites
- 150 g caster sugar
- 50 g water
- 55 g egg whites

## PREPARATION

Sift the icing sugar, cocoa powder and almond flour into a bowl and add the first 55 g egg whites.
Stir gently in the mixture with a wooden spoon for a short moment.

Boil water and sugar.
When the syrup reaches a temperature of 110°C, then start whipping the other 55 g of egg whites, until they are stiff.
When the syrup reaches a temperature of 118°C, pour the syrup into the whipped egg whites.
Whip the egg whites until they cool down to 50°C.
The meringue is mixed into the icing sugar and almond mixture with a wooden spoon by 2 times.
Gently stir the dough until you get the desired consistency.

Pipe the macaron mass on a baking sheet with baking paper.
Use a 10 mm round tip to pipe them.

Bake them in a 160-150°C preheated convection oven for approximately 4-5 minutes.
Open the oven door so the steam can get out.
Turn down to 140-130°C and bake them until finished for approximately 10-12 minutes.
