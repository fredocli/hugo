# HAZELNUT PRALINÉ 60%

For about 40 pcs. macarons.

## INGREDIENTS


- 220 g whole hazelnuts without skin
- 150 g caster sugar
- 20 g water
- 100 g dark chocolate 57% cocoa
- 150 g unsalted butter

## BEFORE YOU START

Turn on the convection oven and set it to 150°C.
Prepare a baking sheet with baking paper.

## PREPARATION

Put the hazelnuts on another baking sheet or in an oven proof dish.
Bake for about 10 minutes.
Remember to stir in them occasionally to achieve an even roasting.

Pour water in a saucepan and add the sugar.
Put the saucepan on the stove over strong heat until it boils.
When the syrup reaches a temperature of 120°C, add the roasted hazelnuts.
Stir and mix the roasted hazelnuts and the syrup together.
After a few minutes, the syrup starts to crystallize.
Continue boiling while stirring constantly and gently.
The sugar begins to melt and caramelize.
Turn down the heat and continue to stir.
All the sugar must be melted and caramelized.
As soon as they have a nice caramel colour, the hazelnuts are finished.
Quickly pour them onto the prepared baking sheet with baking paper.

When the hazelnuts and the caramel is cooled down to room temperature, chop them with a food processor for about 2 minutes, until it becomes liquid.
Add the coarsely chopped dark chocolate in the food processor and run for a few more seconds so that it mixes well together and the mass is homogeneous.
Remove the praliné from the food processor and let it cool to room temperature.
Use a microwave to get butter to a creamy consistency.
Finally, mix the butter into the mass with a whisk.
