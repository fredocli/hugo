## INGREDIENTS


### For the dough

- 500 g wheat flour
- 10 g salt
- 100 g caster sugar
- 25 g fresh yeast
- 2 whole eggs
- 175 g whole milk
- 125 g unsalted butter
- 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp. ground cardamom

### For the remonce filling

- 165 g soft unsalted butter
- 165 g caster sugar
- 2 tsp. ground cinnamon
>
- 1 egg for egg wash
- Pearl sugar to sprinkle

## PREPARATION

Pour the cold milk into a bowl and stir the yeast into it.
Add the eggs, flour, sugar, salt, cinnamon and cardamom and knead the dough in a stand mixer until it is smooth and shiny and does not stick to the side of the bowl.
It takes about 15 minutes at medium speed.
Cut the butter in small pieces and add it to the dough.
Knead for another 15 minutes until the dough is smooth.
Cover the dough with a plastic bag and leave to proof for 30 minutes at room temperature.
While the dough is proofing, mix the ingredients for the filling to a uniform mixture.
Sprinkle flour onto the table and roll out the dough to a rectangle of 20 x 60 cm.
Spread a thin layer of light remonce on 2/3 of the dough surface.

Now you have three layers.
Roll out the dough to a rectangle of 20 x 40 cm, and cut it into 20 strips of 40 cm.

Twist each strip by twisting the ends in opposite direction 6-7 times.
Twist the dough twice around your index finger and middle finger.
Fold the end of the dough over the two folds and place it between your index finger and middle finger.
Remove you fingers, so the tip of the dough-strip fastens inside the roll.
Place the swirls on baking sheets covered with baking paper.
Put the baking sheets in a heating cabinet for approximately 1 hour until the swirls have doubled in size.
Brush with the egg wash and sprinkle with pearl sugar.
Bake them at 170Â°C for about 12-15 minutes.
