# ITALIAN MERINGUE

## INGREDIENTS


- 150 g egg whites
- 300 g caster sugar
- 100 g water

## PREPARATION

Pour the egg whites into a stand mixer bowl.
Pour sugar and water into a saucepan and bring to a boil.
Check the temperature using a sugar thermometer.
When the sugar reaches 100°C, start whipping the egg whites at high speed.
When the sugar reaches 121°C, turn down the speed and add sugar gradually.
Let the stand mixer run until the meringue has cooled down again.

## TIPS

Add a little sugar at the beginning of whipping the egg whites to prevent them from separating.

Replace a part of the sugar with glucose if you want a less sweet meringue.

Adding salt is only helpful if you use fresh egg whites.
Fresh egg whites are slimy, and salt makes it more liquid, but also makes it more fluffy and stiff.
Useful if you use fresh eggs and you whip egg whites by hand.

Fat prevents the egg whites from becoming fluffy and stiff, so check the bowl and whisk - it must be completely clean and free of fat.

Egg yolk in the egg whites can also prevent the egg whites from becoming fluffy and stiff.
