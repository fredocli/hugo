For 2 pies of 16 cm in diameter or 1 pie of 16 cm in diameter and 4 pies of 7 cm in diameter.

## INGREDIENTS


- 150 g sea buckthorn berries
- 40 g water
- 125 g caster sugar
- 150 g whole eggs (3 whole eggs)
- 2 g leaf gelatine (1 pc.)
- 125 g unsalted butter

## PREPARATION

Soak the leaf gelatine in cold water.
Put the sea buckthorn berries in a saucepan with the 40 g of water.
Cook it for 5 minutes over medium heat.
The berries are blended and sieved with a fine sieve.
Discard the pulp and pour the juice into a bowl.
Mix eggs and sugar in the juice.
Whisk thoroughly to homogenize the cream.
Place the bowl over a water bath.
Cook slowly while stirring until the cream thickens.
Remove the bowl from the heat.
Pull the leaf gelatine out of the water, gently wring the water out of it and mix it into the hot cream.
Sift with a fine sieve again so that there are no lumps.
When the temperature drops to 40Â°C, unsalted butter is added stepwise in small cubes.
Stir well, cover the cream with a piece of plastic film and put it in the refrigerator.
